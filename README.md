# Shapes Application

## Overview

The **Shapes Application** is a foundational C# project designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts, including the use of interfaces, polymorphism, and class design. The application revolves around an `IShape` interface and its implementations for common geometric shapes: `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`.

This project is specifically tailored for **BSc Computing students** at the **University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI)**, studying the module **UG409765 - Software Construction**. It serves as a practical exercise in two key areas:
1. **Unit Testing with NUnit**: Writing and running unit tests to validate the functionality of classes.
2. **XML Comments**: Adding and generating internal documentation using XML comments.

## Key Features

- **`IShape` Interface**: Defines a contract for geometric shapes, including methods to calculate the area and perimeter, and draw the shape.
- **Shape Implementations**:
  - **Circle**: Represents a circle with a specific radius.
  - **Rectangle**: Represents a rectangle with width and height.
  - **Triangle**: Represents a triangle with a base and height.
- **Windows Forms Application**:
  - Allows the user to select a shape and provide dimensions.
  - Draws the shape on a canvas.

## Learning Objectives

This project provides hands-on experience with:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Write and execute unit tests for shape classes using NUnit.
   - Validate methods such as `GetArea()` and `GetPerimeter()`.
2. **XML Comments**:
   - Document classes, methods, and properties using XML comments.
   - Generate XML documentation files to demonstrate professional internal documentation practices.
